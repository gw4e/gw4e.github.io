## Introduction
The GraphWalker documentation states that there are two testing types:<br/>
1. <b>Online</b> testing means that a model-based testing tool connects directly to an SUT and tests it dynamically.<br/>
2. <b>Offline</b> means generating a test sequence once, that can be later run automatically... Notice that in that case, you have to save the output of the Offline tool somewhere, use a java editor to  create a java class and add a test method whose body would be this output reformatted.<br/>

In this tutorial, you will learn what is Online and Offline GraphWalker testing and see how Offline can help to debug your tests.
