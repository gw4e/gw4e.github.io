## Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Offline Runner. 
Offline means generating a test sequence once, that can be later run automatically. Or, because your model might contains modelization problems, you can use this feature to generate a sequence proving that the model with the path generator(s) together with the stop condition(s) works correctly.
