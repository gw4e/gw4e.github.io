## Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a fixed guided path to be run for debugging. 
While implementing new steps in an existing graph, or when you want to focus specifically on a portion of a graph, it might 
take a long time to reach the exact path you would like to go thru making debugging difficult. Therefore it would be useful 
to have a kind of a guided path which only includes a subset of the model edges (golden path). Once debugged your golden path
you can forget it and have more usual random paths for better coverage.
