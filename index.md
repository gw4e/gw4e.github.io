summary: "<a href='http://graphwalker.github.io/'>GraphWalker</a><b> is a open source Model Based Testing tool for test automation. The GW4E project, distinct from the GraphWalker project, aims to deliver Eclipse plugins providing the ability to use the GraphWalker standard features (and much more) directly in the Eclipse IDE.

## Introduction 

[Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/neon/) is a platform that has been designed from the ground up for building integrated application development tooling. The value of the platform is that it encourages: rapid development of integrated features based on a plug-in model. 
GW4E plugins are built on top of the Eclipse *J*ava *D*evelopment *T*ools. JDT provides the tool plug-ins that implement a Java IDE supporting the development of any Java application. 
This project leverages the Eclipse JDT and [GraphWalker](http://graphwalker.github.io/) apis to deliver a GraphWalker environment for Eclipse developers. They add a GW4E project nature and GW4E perspective to the Eclipse Workbench as well as a number of views, editors, wizards, builders, and refactoring tools. 
Using GW4E will help you to develop faster your GraphWalker projects and ease their maintenance.
